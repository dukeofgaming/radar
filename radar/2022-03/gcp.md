Deepened my experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) at Flexion Inc., working on government mainframe modernization projects. Utilized a broad range of GCP services, including Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Storage, CloudSQL to develop and deploy scalable, cloud-native applications and services efficiently.
