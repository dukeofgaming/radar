Advocated for Developer Relations (DevRel) alongside Developer Experience (DevEx) at Flexion Inc., emphasizing the importance of engaging with and supporting the developer community. 

Contributed to tech research like durable functions, Camunda for standards-based workflow automation, talks like using AI to augment developers instead of relpacing them, and the adoption of new practices and technologies to foster a positive developer environment like Docs as Code.

These topics sparked conversations on our approaches to engineering around reliability, reusability, empowering developers and creating knowledge incrementally.
