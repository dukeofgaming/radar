Worked extensively with C# for government mainframe modernization projects at Flexion Inc., utilizing it alongside React, Typescript, and Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This included full-stack development and DevSecOps roles, emphasizing modern cloud-native applications and services.

Worked on integrating GCP Secret Manager to microservices given that we had a restriction from using the [External Secrets Operator for Kubernetes](https://external-secrets.io/) in addition to collaborating on some features using TDD.
