Led migration from CloudRun to GKE for a modernization project. Adopting Helm involved working on an ADR to make the case for it as a templating, deployment and release tool closer to kubernetes-native patterns to move away from deploying microservices with Terraform to kubernetes, as this would create state management issues between Terraform and Kubernetes, Helm being better suited to handle Kubernetes states related to service deployments.

Created a Helm chart that would allow us to abstract service deployment, which saved us valuable time from not having to create repeated manifests for each one of our microservices.
