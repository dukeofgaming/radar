Took on Terraform as part of my new responsibilites as part of my new responsibilities as part of a client project.

Started at zero knowledge, only knowing Kubernetes as IaC, so started to learn by doing and consulting the following Udemy course: [Learn DevOps: Infrastructure Automation With Terraform](https://www.udemy.com/share/101X203@1Vgl-NO_bnvVFT2pargfXc_7BcSau9vyG2ECsvW3BN4T8ogqCT8Dmwd7n0c8lxxL/)
