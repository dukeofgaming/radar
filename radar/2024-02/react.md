Refactored React with Typescript for updating several components for an unemployment insurance system with the objective of doing functional testing using the React Testing Library. 

As a team we made the decision to use prop-drilling and the React Hook Form on a case by case basis, instead of introducing a state management library like Redux.

The result were easy to maintain functional tests that aligned almost 1:1 to the acceptance criteria in our user stories.
