Tech Radar is a visual representation of a technology landscape, tracking the adoption and evaluation of various technologies, tools, and methodologies within an organization. It uses "blips" to represent individual items, which are placed in one of four quadrants and categorized into rings based on their adoption status.

The Tech Radar methodology helps organizations maintain a clear understanding of their technology landscape, identify opportunities for innovation, and make informed decisions about technology adoption and usage.
