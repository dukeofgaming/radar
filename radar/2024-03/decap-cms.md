Looking for governable alternatives to Joomla! for a personal project to reduce overhead from the complexity to backup and manage infrastructure such as databases for what is in the end static content, and how much this distracts from content creation compared to adopting something like the Docs as Code philosophy.

Having had to migrate away from different CMS in the past has been a hindrance to have to recreate the UX being dependent of each CMS' plugin ecosystem, not to mention being dependent to updates to the plugins.

The wide-adoption of Markdown and the simplicity and ubiquity of Docs as Code and Git based workflows like Gitflow make the approach of a flat-file Mardown as the source of truth a very attractive option. Moreover, the JAMstack philosophy embodies all this while highlighting simplicity in a decoupled architecture. 

Decap in particular is headless, increasing the optionality for future improvements without having to build the front-end with the CMS itself as a large dependency.
