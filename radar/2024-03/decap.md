Looking for alternatives to #joomla given the overhead of complexity to backup and manage infrastructure, and how much this distracts from content creation compared to adopting a #docs-as-code philosophy 

Having had to migrate away from different CMS & forums usually impacts content creation and slows UX and adds risk to sites.

The wide-adoption of #markdown and the simplicity and universality of #docs-as-code and #git based workflows like [Automerge](./automerge.md), #gitflow, and decap itself make the approach of a flat-file Mardown as the source of truth a very attractive option. Moreover, Decap is headless, hence the name.
